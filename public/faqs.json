      "question": "Who do you work with?",
      "answer": "We mostly work with physical businesses that have 1 to 3 locations or are just starting out. But we are open to working with any industry."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can we get started?",
      "answer": "You can make your payment above to get started. After that, you'll be redirected to a form where you can share your business details and optionally book a meeting with us. If you're not 100% sure yet, you can book a free intro call to explore the possibilities and ask any questions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does payment work?",
      "answer": "You can pay full, but 50% before we start and 50% after delivery is also possible. Payments are made securely through Stripe. You will also receive an invoice after the payment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer refunds?",
      "answer": "No, we don’t offer refunds because each project takes a lot of time. That’s why we offer to split the payment, so you only pay the second half when you’re happy with the result."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don’t like the design?",
      "answer": "We always send you a first version of the website for feedback. If you’re not happy, we will adjust the design. If the full website is already done, we can’t redesign everything from scratch."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any extra costs?",
      "answer": "No extra payments from us. If your website needs things like hosting or a paid subscription, you pay for those directly to the provider."
    },
    {
        "question": "Do you offer ongoing support?",
        "answer": "Yes.
